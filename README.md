# Pivot Table for JSON Data

## About

This project was built using [Amanda's React Boilerplate](https://github.com/albullington/amanda-react-boilerplate), which leverages a simple Express server, the Airbnb Style Guide for linting, and a basic React/JavaScript/Node.js setup. 

## Installing dependencies and starting the server

First, install dependencies: 

`npm install`

Then, compile a new Webpack bundle: 

`npm run compile`

Finally, start the Express server. You can go to localhost:3001 to make sure the server is running and React is compiling correctly. The server uses Nodemon to automatically restart if any changes are made. 

`npm start`

## Using the pivot table

This pivot table was made with the [react-pivottable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pivottable) library.
